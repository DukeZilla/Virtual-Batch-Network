#Virtal Batch Network

This program is essentially a VPN with the use of batch / vbs scripting,
and connects to VPNs via rasdial command.

For configurations you must have your VPN information provided from an external source.
e.g Vpnbook.com
After you're done configuring it will be saved under "loadvpn.cfg".

Telnetmyip.bat is used to reveal your new ip address after the VPN
is activated.
